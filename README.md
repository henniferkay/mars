# mars

## Background
The aim of this project was to extract and analyze information about Mars from NASA's website.

## Methods
There were two parts to this project--two Jupyter Notebooks were written, respectively. First, titles sand preview text from news articles about Mars were scraped via Python's Beautiful Soup library. The other half of the assignment focused on analyzing the planet's weather. The data were originally presented as a table on NASA's website, which was scraped using Beautiful Soup. Alternatively, scraping could be achieved using Pandas library's read_html function. The scraped data were organized and stored as a list before being assembled into a DataFrame for analysis. The number of months, minimum temperatures (daily and monthly), and atmospheric pressure on Mars were computed and plotted on graphs.
